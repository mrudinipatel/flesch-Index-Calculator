# Flesch-Kincaid-Index-Calculator ðŸ“š

This project was created for CIS*2500.  
Assignment #2: Files and String Processing  

This program calculates the text readability within a provided external file source. It does this by counting the number of words, sentences, and syllables in the text to calculate the flesch-kincaid index score. The score is used to indicate the degree of readability, where the average flesch index score lies on a scale between 0-100 (100 being easy to read and 0 being difficult to read).
